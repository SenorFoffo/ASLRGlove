# ASLRGlove
* **Overview**

Our project is a cross-platform gadget that will greatly help the hearing impaired, and technology enthusiasts. It will introduce the users to a more natural way when dealing with computers in their daily lives. 
It relies on two magnetometer sensors that sense the proximity of three magnets that are attached to the finger of the glove. 
In concept it can be configured to detect any kind of hand gesture or sign language.
